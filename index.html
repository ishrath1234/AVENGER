    What is the concept of Avengers?
    In 1995, the Avengers Initiative is created by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who envisions a group of heroes
    working together in response to planetary threats, following the appearance of superhumans such as Carol Danvers. He
    names his plan after her U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".
